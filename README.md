# Wordle
This is a JavaScript implementation of the popular word guessing game Wordle. The goal of this project is to demonstrate my technical abilities and showcase it as part of my JavaScript project portfolio. This implementation uses Node.js with the chalk library for colorful console output and prompt-sync for synchronous user input.
